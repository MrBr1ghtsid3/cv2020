      <h3><strong>About</strong></h3>
        <img class="my-photo" src="Images/bio.png" alt="">
        <p>My name is Tsvetoslav "Sean" Shalev and I am an IT enthusiast, looking to build a career out of his passion for technology. I posses
          experience with Windows 10, macOS and Linux (Mint/Ubuntu), computer hardware and software
          troubleshooting, as well as networking fundamentals and scripting. I am comfortable with HTML 5, CSS, and basic JavaScript, using Atom or VS Code IDEs.</p>
        <p>I have developed key technical skills over the years, working as a freelance IT consultant and a service
          desk engineer for one of UK's top 50 MSPs, by building, upgrading and maintaining computers and systems; I have also
          accumulated a wealth of troubleshooting experience, transferable skills such as excellent
          customer service, teamwork, the ability to handle irate customers in a calm and professional
          manner, process-adherence, escalating to senior management when needed, excellent time
          management skills and workloads prioritisation when working to set SLAs.</p>
        <p>As a firm believer in civilised discourse, and collaborative effort, my current goal is to secure a front-end web developer role with a team of good people, so I can continue to hone my technical capabilities and
          support a career as an IT professional.</p>
